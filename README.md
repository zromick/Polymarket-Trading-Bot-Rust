## What is this?

This project is a self-hosted trading co-pilot for [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com). Instead of manually refreshing polymarket.com and tracking wallets by hand, it gives you:

- **Instant copy-trading** — follow one or many high-performing wallets with configurable sizing, filters, and exit rules
- **Portfolio overview** — see your open positions, notional exposure, and active trades in one consolidated view
- **Live activity stream** — every trade from your targets, streamed as it happens and organized for quick scanning
- **AI-powered analysis** — ask the Agent about any market, trader, or position; get structured notes (sentiment, timing, catalysts, risks) and guidance
- **Simulation mode** — dry-run strategies with no real capital before you go live

It works across politics, sports, crypto, and macro. You adjust behavior via `trade.toml` (targets + filters). Everything runs locally; API keys and private keys stay on your machine.

## Why this exists

Copy trading itself is not the hard part — doing it *sensibly* is. Even on fast chains (Solana, Jito, etc.), a lot of people still lost money because the “strategy” was just mirroring a single wallet. That’s fragile.

You actually need:

- Multiple leaders, not a single hero wallet
- Filters on market type, timing, and size
- Rules for when to follow, when to ignore, and when to exit

That is where **AI** is useful: it can help reason about signals and prioritize which trades to act on.

This bot came out of several months of iterating on filters, timing, and position sizing. Backtests, simulation runs, and a small live balance pointed toward **slow, consistent compounding** instead of chasing volatility.

Most existing Polymarket copy bots are written in TypeScript or Python and tend to be single-threaded. This stack is **Rust front to back** (server + Leptos/WASM UI) so it can process WebSocket feeds and copy decisions in real time while keeping the UI responsive.

When multiple leaders pile into the same market, the **AI Agent** can help you rank those signals (e.g. by PnL in that category, historical win rate, etc.) so you don’t blindly copy everyone. As markets and leaders evolve, you can use the Agent to periodically reassess which wallets are still worth following.

The design goal isn’t “hit a home run trade”, it’s **durable growth**: diversified risk across sports/crypto/politics/macro, plus an AI-assisted overlay that helps you keep your edge over months, not minutes.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

**Machine**

- **Linux** or **macOS** (recommended) or **Windows** (WSL2 is easier than native Windows for Rust + Trunk; native Windows works if `cargo` and `trunk` are on `PATH`).
- ~2–4 GB free disk for Rust toolchain + first compile; stable internet for crate downloads.

**Rust (required)**

1. Install **[rustup](https://rustup.rs/)** if you don’t have Rust yet.
2. Use the default **stable** toolchain (this project targets Rust **1.70+**).
3. Confirm in a **new terminal**:

   ```bash
   rustc --version   # should show 1.70 or higher
   cargo --version
   ```

**Polymarket (for live trading)**

- A Polymarket account, **USDC on Polygon**, and **CLOB API** credentials. See the [official CLOB docs](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/). You still need a valid `config.json` to start the app; use **simulation mode** (step 7) if you only want to explore the UI first.

### 2. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HyperBuildX/Polymarket-Trading-Bot-Rust.git
cd Polymarket-Trading-Bot-Rust
```

### 3. Configure

Create two files in the project root:

**`config.json`** — your Polymarket CLOB credentials:

```jsonc
{
  "polymarket": {
    "gamma_api_url": "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com",
    "clob_api_url": "https://clob.polymarket.com",
    "api_key": "your-api-key",
    "api_secret": "your-api-secret",
    "api_passphrase": "your-api-passphrase",
    "private_key": "your-private-key",
    "proxy_wallet_address": null,
    "signature_type": 0
  }
}
```

**`trade.toml`** — who to copy and how. Use any leader's wallet address from [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) as `target_address` or in `target_addresses`:

```toml
[copy]
target_address = "0x1979ae6B7E6534dE9c4539D0c205E582cA637C9D"
# or target_addresses = ["0x...", "0x..."]
size_multiplier = 0.01
poll_interval_sec = 0.5

[exit]
take_profit = 0      # 0 = off
stop_loss = 0
trailing_stop = 0

[filter]
buy_amount_limit_in_usd = 0
entry_trade_sec = 0
trade_sec_from_resolve = 0
```

**`.env`** *(not required, for AI Agent)*:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
# or OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### 4. Build & Run

```bash
# Build the frontend (once)
cd frontend && trunk build --release && cd ..

# Run
cargo run --release --bin main_copytrading
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** — that's it. Dashboard, agent, logs, portfolio, everything is there.

### 5. Simulation mode (no real orders)

```bash
cargo run --release --bin main_copytrading -- --simulation
```

Perfect for testing your setup, exploring the UI, and evaluating traders before risking capital.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Rust** | 1.70+ |
| **Polymarket account** | USDC on Polygon + CLOB API keys ([docs](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/)) |
| **Frontend tooling** | `cargo install trunk` and `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` |

---

## How it works

The bot subscribes to Polymarket's **activity WebSocket** (`wss://ws-live-data.polymarket.com`) and filters by your target addresses client-side. Trades are pushed the instant they happen — you copy with minimal delay and see them in the UI in real time.

A separate loop refreshes positions for the portfolio view. All copy-trading is driven by the live stream, not polling.

```
Activity WebSocket ──▶ Filter by targets ──▶ Copy trade ──▶ Dashboard + Logs
                                                │
                                         Exit rules (TP/SL/trailing)
```

---

## AI Agent

The Agent tab turns your dashboard into a research terminal. Pick a provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, or Claude) from the dropdown — it uses whichever API keys you set in `.env`.

The agent follows the **Monitor → Analyze** method (inspired by [Mahoraga](https://mahoraga.dev/)):

- You ask a question about a market, a position, or a trader
- The LLM researches sentiment, timing, catalysts, and red flags
- You get back a structured note: **Signal → Research → Context → Confidence → Guidance**

No execution — research and guidance only. You decide when to act.

## Config Reference

**`config.json`** — CLOB API credentials and wallet:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `clob_api_url` | Yes | `https://clob.polymarket.com` |
| `private_key` | Yes | Polygon wallet private key |
| `api_key` / `api_secret` / `api_passphrase` | Yes | From Polymarket CLOB dashboard |
| `proxy_wallet_address` | No | For proxy/Magic wallets |
| `signature_type` | No | `0` = EOA, `1` = Proxy, `2` = GnosisSafe |

**`trade.toml`** — copy-trading behavior:

| Section | Key fields |
|---------|------------|
| `[copy]` | `target_address` or `target_addresses`, `size_multiplier`, `poll_interval_sec`, `revert_trade` |
| `[exit]` | `take_profit`, `stop_loss`, `trailing_stop` (0 = off) |
| `[filter]` | `buy_amount_limit_in_usd`, `entry_trade_sec`, `trade_sec_from_resolve` |
| `[ui]` | `delta_highlight_sec`, `delta_animation_sec` |

Top-level: `clob_host`, `chain_id`, `port`, `simulation`.

## Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Build frontend
cd frontend && trunk build --release && cd ..

# 2. Run (serves both API and UI on one port)
cargo run --release --bin main_copytrading
```

Access from any device on your network at `http://<your-server-ip>:8000`. The binary is the single entry point — no separate frontend server needed.

## Project Layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/bin/main_copytrading.rs` | Entrypoint, HTTP server, agent endpoints |
| `src/activity_stream.rs` | WebSocket client for real-time trades |
| `src/copy_trading.rs` | Config, filters, copy logic, exit loop, position diff |
| `src/api.rs` | Polymarket CLOB/Data API client |
| `src/clob_sdk.rs` | FFI bindings to the CLOB SDK `.so` |
| `src/web_state.rs` | Shared state for UI, `/api/state` JSON + SSE |
| `frontend/` | Leptos (Rust → WASM): dashboard, agent, logs, portfolio, settings |
